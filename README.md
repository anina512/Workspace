WORKSPACE: A THREE IN ONE APPLICATION

Workspace is a smart 3 in one Desktop Application built using Python..
Thinking why it is called ‘Smart’, it’s because you can create , edit and paint at one place.
Workspace also allows you to do a lot of new things .
These include:

1)Login/Register:You can store all your documents and other related work at one place i.e. your account.
With Workspace , you can easily create an account for free and store all your things at one place.

2)Encryption/Decryption : Want to keep your work private? Workspace allows you to easily do that with the Encryption feature.
You can secure your work with passwords to restrict access.

3)Paint : With the Paint feature of Workspace , you can easily store diagrams and edit them.

4)Journal: Often we want to keep a track of our tasks, so there comes the use of the Journal application.
You can easily maintain a record of your tasks, add new tasks, delete some and keep them private also as they are logged in your
